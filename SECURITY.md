## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
3. **DO** send a detailed report to our security team

### How to Report

**Email**: security@smart-contract-analyzer.dev

**PGP Key**: Available at [link to PGP key]

**Include in your report**:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and attack scenarios
- Your contact information for follow-up
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Updates**: Regular updates on investigation progress
4. **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for critical issues
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure after fix deployment

## 🎯 Security Scope

### In Scope

The following components are within our security scope:

#### Core Analysis Engine
- Solidity parser vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution
- Vulnerability detection bypass scenarios
- Gas analysis calculation errors that could mislead users
- Memory safety issues in parsing logic

#### CLI Interface
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- File system access control issues
- Input validation bypass
- Configuration file parsing vulnerabilities

#### Report Generation
- Template injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in HTML reports
- Information disclosure in reports
- File path traversal issues

#### Dependencies
- Known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
- Supply chain security issues
- Dependency confusion attacks

### Out of Scope

The following are generally outside our security scope:

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Issues in user-provided smart contracts
- **False Positives**: Incorrect vulnerability reports (use regular issue tracking)
- **Performance Issues**: Slow analysis speed (unless causing DoS)
- **Feature Requests**: New vulnerability detection patterns
- **Third-party Services**: Issues with external blockchain RPCs or APIs
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting users rather than the software

## 🛠️ Security Features

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- File type verification for uploaded contracts
- Size limits on input files and data
- Path traversal prevention

### Safe Parsing
- Sandboxed parsing environment
- No execution of contract code
- Memory and time limits for parsing operations
- Error handling to prevent crashes

### Output Sanitization
- HTML output is properly escaped
- No dynamic code execution in templates
- Secure file operations for report generation

### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Verification of dependency integrity

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Static Analysis
We perform regular static analysis of our codebase:
- `cargo clippy` for Rust-specific security issues
- `cargo audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
- Custom security linting rules
- Code review for security considerations

### Dynamic Testing
- Fuzzing of parser components
- Integration testing with malicious inputs
- Memory safety testing with Valgrind/AddressSanitizer
- Performance testing under load

### Third-party Security Reviews
- Annual security audits by external experts
- Participation in bug bounty programs
- Peer review from security community

## 🚀 Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
```bash
# Verify installation integrity
cargo install --locked smart-contract-analyzer

# Build from source for maximum security
git clone https://github.com/org/smart-contract-analyzer
cd smart-contract-analyzer
cargo build --release
```

### Usage Security
```bash
# Use read-only file permissions when possible
chmod 444 contract.sol

# Analyze contracts in isolated directories
mkdir analysis && cd analysis
smart-contract-analyzer analyze -f ../contract.sol

# Verify output file permissions
ls -la report.html
```

### Environment Security
- Run analysis in sandboxed environments for untrusted contracts
- Keep the analyzer updated to latest version
- Use configuration files with appropriate permissions
- Monitor system resources during analysis

## 📊 Vulnerability Categories

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Arbitrary file write capabilities
- Authentication bypass leading to privilege escalation

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Local privilege escalation
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- Denial of service affecting availability

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure of non-sensitive data
- Resource consumption issues
- Input validation bypass with limited impact

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information disclosure
- Configuration issues
- Low-impact availability issues

## 🏆 Security Recognition

### Hall of Fame

We maintain a security hall of fame to recognize researchers who have responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities:

- **[Date]** - [Researcher Name] - [Brief description of vulnerability]

### Bug Bounty Program

While we don't currently offer monetary rewards, we recognize security researchers through:
- Public acknowledgment in our security hall of fame
- Contribution recognition in release notes
- LinkedIn and Twitter acknowledgments (with permission)
- Conference presentation opportunities
